# **Project Proposal: LI-DAO DEV - Public Official Asset Disclosure and Citizen Supervision System**

---

## **Project Background**

In countries with authoritarian regimes and limited freedom of speech, such as China, transparency in public officials' assets, management of petitions, handling of whistleblower cases, and fair resolution of citizens' rights protection are even more critical to promoting social justice and accountability. However, traditional supervision and processing models in such environments face significant challenges, including strict censorship, retaliation against whistleblowers, lack of independent oversight, and systemic corruption. To address these pain points, the **LI-DAO DEV Public Official Asset Disclosure and Citizen Supervision System** was conceived.

This system leverages blockchain technology, utilizing its decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof features, combined with zero-knowledge proof technology to protect privacy. It aims to create a fair, efficient, and trustworthy social governance tool that covers multiple application scenarios, including **public official asset disclosure, petition event management, whistleblower case handling, and citizen rights protection monitoring**. The system incorporates a native virtual currency, **$LI (Li Coin)**, to incentivize participation, facilitate payments, and support governance, fostering an ecosystem of active citizen engagement and sustainable development.

## **System Objectives**

1. **Empower Citizen Participation in Supervision**  
   Encourage ordinary citizens to participate in supervising public officials' assets, petition events, whistleblower cases, and rights protection incidents, strengthening societal oversight in environments where traditional mechanisms are unreliable or heavily censored.

2. **Ensure Information Authenticity**  
   Implement multi-layered verification mechanisms to ensure the authenticity of submitted information while minimizing the risk of fabricated accusations, which are often used as tools of suppression in authoritarian states.

3. **Balance Privacy and Safety**  
   Protect the privacy and safety of whistleblowers and related parties in countries where retaliation is common, using advanced cryptographic methods to shield identities.

4. **Decentralization and Transparency**  
   Utilize blockchain technology to guarantee transparency, immutability, and decentralized storage and governance, bypassing centralized control and potential government interference.

5. **Quick Response and Accountability**  
   Establish efficient case tracking and handling mechanisms to ensure timely and fair resolution of petitions, whistleblower cases, and rights protection incidents, even in restrictive environments.

6. **Incentivize Citizen Participation**  
   Reward citizens with **$LI (Li Coin)** for their contributions, encouraging active participation in supervision and information submission, particularly in societies where civic engagement is discouraged.
